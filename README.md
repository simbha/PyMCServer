PyMCServer
==========

PyMCServer is a cross-platform, web-based Minecraft server administration
console written in Python. It supports multiple servers and is very
lightweight, much more so than even the Minecraft server software itself.

Note that PyMCServer is in **ALPHA**. It is unfinished and bugs are everywhere.

Features
--------
  * No installation required! Simply run `start.py` to start PyMCServer!
  * Run multiple servers at once!
  * Supports running CraftBukkit servers.

Pre-run
------------
Be sure you have Python installed. On Windows, you can go to http://python.org
to get it. Get the latest 2.x version, not 3.x. Be sure you take note of where
you install it. Then, follow the first answer to this question:

On GNU/Linux, it should be easy enough to figure out.

Assuming you now have Python, then you can proceed to the next step below.

Windows
-------
Install Python from http://python.org/download/. Note that Python 3 is not
compatible with PyMCServer.

Then double click `start.py` to start up PyMCServer. A console window will
open. Don't close it, or else PyMCServer will stop working.

Linux
-----
PyMCServer requires no installation. Simply run `python start.py` in a command
prompt/terminal to start PyMCServer.

Notices
------------
1. Internet Explorer 9 does not even load the login page on our tests, so you
should use something else if the same thing happens to you.

2. You can get the readline module for Python to let you have enhanced
functionality in the console. This does not apply to the web console.
