===== PyMCServer on Windows =====
You will need Python, from http://python.org. Be sure to get the right installer intended for your Windows installation's architecture. Take note on where you install it! You will need to remember.

You can find a Windows version of pyreadline at https://launchpad.net/pyreadline/+download , which helps console function. This does not apply to the web console.

To run PyMCServer, just run start.py in the PyMCServer directory:
C:\Users\whoever\PyMCServer>C:\<where you put python>\python start.py

NOTICE: Internet Explorer 9 does not even load the login page on our tests, so you should use something else if the same thing happens to you.
