===== PyMCServer on Windows =====
You will need Python, from http://python.org. Be sure to get the right installer intended for your Windows installation's architecture.

You can find a Windows version of pyreadline at https://launchpad.net/pyreadline/+download , which helps console function.

To run PyMCServer, just run start.bat in the PyMCServer directory:
C:\Users\whoever\PyMCServer>start.bat
